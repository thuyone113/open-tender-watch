module Entities
  # Refreshes the pre-computed contract_count and total_contracted_value columns
  # on the entities table. Called:
  #   - After every import run (ImportService#call / call_all / call_streaming)
  #   - After every dedup run (dedup rake tasks)
  #   - After the flag scoring cycle (flags:run_all)
  #
  # A single UPDATE … SET … = (SELECT …) is much faster than loading all
  # entities into Ruby and calling #update! on each one.
  #
  # Price logic (three-tier):
  #   1. Use total_effective_price when available (actual awarded amount).
  #   2. When missing, divide base_price by the winner count — each supplier's
  #      allocated share of the framework ceiling.
  #   3. When no winners at all, use 0 — the contract hasn't been awarded yet.
  # Using raw base_price multiplies the framework ceiling across every winner
  # row, producing wildly inflated totals (e.g. €315M × 12 suppliers = €3.78B
  # for a single framework agreement).
